# Simple-Port-Monitor
Small PowerShell app that monitors port connections via netstat with filtering, looping, and output to logfile mechanisms to detect connections to chosen ports.

USAGE: Run '.\SimplePortWatcher.ps1' in the directory you downloaded it to. Upon execution, the program will prompt you for what port you want to watch. Provide the port number, and walk away. When you want to stop monitoring, kill the terminal (click X in top right or Control-C in terminal) and check the logfile at 'C:\ScriptOutput\PortWatcherOutput.txt'.
